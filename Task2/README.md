Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  - This is a very thorough and well-written EDA. The list of variables and their units was a nice touch that would help give the audience valuable context.
  - For the scatter plots, maybe using ax.scatter in favor of ax.plot would produce a cleaner visualization for the continuous relationships.
  - Under Multivariate Summaries → True C6H6 and Weather Conditions → Means and Standard Deviations of True C6H6 by Weather Condition Levels, in the cell that says "The mean C6H6 is about 2 lower for the C6H6, which is pretty small, and the standard deviation is the same.", doesn't specify which group, high or low temp, has the lower mean. A small little tweak but helpful for clarity.
  - Overall this is a very well-written notebook and satisfies all the requirements of task 2 perfectly.
