Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  - Your formatting and explanations in the markdown cells are very clear and thorough- I am able to follow your code pretty seemlessly. Your intrepretations for the grid search and gradient descent outputs stand out to me as particularly strong since they give context to connect the results back to sample average.
  - For the SLR gradient descent result in the "Run the line GD algorithm and compare to the usual regression solution" section, it looks like the b1 value is negative. From what I understand from the instructions, this is should be positive. I'm thinking increasing the b1 step size would help this land on the positive side and closer to Dr. Post's approximation
  - Otherwise, I think this is very well-written code and will be a strong component of our project.
